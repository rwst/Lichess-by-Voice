# Lichess-by-Voice
Practically a playground for my Android/Kotlin experiments that might develop into a minimal useable app.

## Milestones
* The app displays a Lichess game by opening the game endpoint. Questions: Will the display update if a move is made?
* Use SharedPreferences to save and load a dummy access token
* Account linking to get the access token, use openid/AppAuth-Android
