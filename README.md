In 2021 Google demanded I pay my $25 for the dev account. I ignored them because I was not interested and had no non-prepaid credit card. They closed my account. In 2022 I tried to open my acount, paid $25, because I had an idea for an app. But they would not have it. I am permanently banned as a developer. This means there will be no Lichess-by-Voice app from me, in any Play Store (I also can't publish on the Samsung Galaxy Play Store because they check the Google dev account on upload). If you want you can take it from the repo and either install it yourself or even publish it on the store. I don't care anymore. Just like Google cares for me as an Android dev. I have other things to do. Thanks.

# Lichess-by-Voice
lichess.org is a cost-free, ad-free chess server. Lichess, as well as this
app, is Open Source. The app connects to your Lichess account (you can
create one too). In this version, having opened a game, you are enabled
to speak moves in the English language to play the game displayed. You can
view the game on this device or *open the game page on other devices to get
a larger picture*. Other languages are planned.

* To play by voice use long algebraic notation. Examples: e2e4, g8f6.
* For castling specify the King move. Examples: e1g1 or e8c8.
* Promoting a pawn on last rank, you add the name of the piece.
  Examples: a7a8 Queen or b2b1 Rook. Omitting the piece will make it a Queen.

Continuing a game. In this version you can continue the game in your Lichess
ongoing game list that has waited the longest. Choosing from the list will be
implemented in a later version.
