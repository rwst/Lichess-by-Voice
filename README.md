# Lichess-by-Voice
Practically a playground for my Android/Kotlin experiments that might develop into a minimal useable app.

## Milestones
* The app displays a Lichess game by opening the game endpoint. Questions: Will the display update if a move is made?
* If that works do a clean up to remove unused files created.
