lichess.org is a cost-free, ad-free chess server. Lichess, as well as this app, is Open Source.
The app connects to your Lichess account (you can create one too). In this version, having opened
a game, you are enabled to speak moves in the English language to play the game displayed. You can
view the game on this device or open the game page on other devices to get a larger picture. Other
languages are planned.

To play by voice use long algebraic notation. Examples: e2e4, g8f6.
For castling specify the King move. Examples: e1g1 or e8c8.
Promoting a pawn on last rank, you add the name of the piece. Examples: a7a8 Queen or b2b1 Rook.
Omitting the piece will make it a Queen.

Continuing a game. In this version you can continue the game in your Lichess ongoing game list
that has waited the longest. Choosing from the list will be implemented in a later version.
